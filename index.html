									<h2 class="major">About</h2>
									<div class="ex1"><p>Hello friends! My name is Michelle Samson, and I'm the CEO of Vagari Consulting. I originally used the name Vagārī (Latin: a wandering journey) for my travel blog, but it recently became clear to me that it's a relevant description for my career trajectory as well. I always thought I knew exactly what I wanted to be when I grew up, but my path could not have been more meandering and unexpected. I look back now and see that each twist and turn in the road lead me exactly where I'm supposed to be. I now have my own business, and I'm equipped with so many different life and job experiences to help guide others.<br/> 

I'm a creative and analytical thinker with over a decade of experience helping a variety of clients, big and small, elevated and down to earth. I've helped the largest department store in the US generate massive email sales, and I've helped a startup dog rescue find their voice through brand identity.<br/>

Today, I'm putting my innovative process, attention to detail, and ability to thoughtfully diagnose and treat organizational gaps to work for my clients. In the past I was an Editor, Photography Editor, Financial Reporter, Public Relations Account Executive, Jewelry Business Owner, Copywriter, and Senior Manager, so I'm uniquely positioned to be a tremendously well-rounded resource for you and your business.<br/>

Now I look at the name Vagari in a completely different way. Now it is the perfect way to describe the creative road we are about to embark on together.<br/> 

In my spare time I enjoy running, hiking, traveling, reading, partaking in some amateur rescue-dog photography, and playing rec league soccer that I probably take a little too seriously (left over competitiveness from college). I also have an <i>almost</i> unhealthy love for alpacas, hence the inspiration behind the mascot.

										<ul>
										<li>When you're a small business owner/solopreneur, it can be really difficult to create messaging that resonates with your target customers because you're so deep in the weeds all the time. Michelle really helped clarify our messaging. Both our overall business and Instagram following have increased since we began working with her. We hope to have a long working relationship!<br/><b>- Beth Herrild, </b>Owner at <i>Outside the Box Creation</i></li>
										<li>A masterful writer who always brings thoughtful storytelling and knows how to make every word count. Michelle is a dream to work with—the perfect blend of right and left brain, creativity and strategy, and she’s very solution-oriented. There aren’t enough good things to say about her: she’s the exact kind of creative we all hope to work with. <br/><b>- Holly Williams, </b>Specialist Copywriter at <i>Macy’s</i></li>
